# Bankruptcy-Classification

I use data detailing company bankruptcy based on the Taiwan Stock exchange for the years 1999 to 2009 (source: Taiwan Economic Journal via Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction/code) to predict bankruptcy using 6 different Machine Learning Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Extra Trees.

I measure the success of each classifier before and after hyperparameter tuning, and find that the tuned Random Forest Classifier and tuned Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier both perform equally well as the best classifiers on the test set.
